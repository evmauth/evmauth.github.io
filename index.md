## Overview

**EVMAuth** is an advanced implementation of the [ERC-1155] token standard that enables robust EVM-based authorization for Web3 applications.

- **Drastically Reduced Infrastructure:** Eliminate the need for complex auth systems, user databases, and billing infrastructure, removing entire categories of technical debt from your codebase
- **AI-Ready Architecture:** Make your API instantly accessible to AI agents that cannot navigate traditional registration flows, opening your service to the next wave of digital economy growth
- **Built-In Security:** Replace permanent API keys with time-limited access tokens that naturally expire, dramatically reducing your attack surface without complex key rotation policies
- **Seamless Monetization:** For paid APIs, access purchases happen directly through the smart contract with instant settlementâ€”no payment processors, invoicing, or collection issues
- **Flexible Access Control:** Offer different permission levels, durations, and price points with a tiered access control system that gives you precise control over API consumption
